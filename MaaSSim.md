- Presentation
	- Key features of a two-sided mobility platform (non-deterministic, adaptive, heterogeneous behaviour of agents interacting with each other) are explicitly handled via userdefined and flexible python functions.
	- Trace emerging complex dynamics.
	- Instead, the explicit objective of MaaSSim is to support researchers with modelling and reproducing the emerging novel phenomena taking place in the context of two-sided mobility platforms and analyse their disruptive potential for urban transport systems.
- Later TODO
