- Practical examples:
	- **Software Testing and Debugging**: With an understanding of program analysis, you can efficiently debug and test software by understanding the flow and dependencies within the code. This will speed up your development process and increase the stability of your software.
	- **Code Review and Optimization**: Knowledge of program analysis techniques can be used in reviewing code, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimizing the code for better performance, memory management and efficiency.
	- **Security and Vulnerability Assessment**: By understanding static and dynamic analysis, you can identify potential security vulnerabilities in a program without even executing it, thereby improving application safety.
	- **Building Tools**: Building tools such as compilers, interpreters, or IDE features. For example, understanding static analysis is fundamental in building features like autocomplete, code navigation, and static error detection in IDEs.
	- **Reverse Engineering**: If you're working in a situation where you need to understand a piece of software without proper documentation, program analysis techniques will allow you to make sense of the program's behavior, structure, and operation.
	- **Project Management**: As a project lead, understanding these concepts will help you make informed decisions about the software development process, choose appropriate methodologies and tools, assess the quality of work, and ensure efficient performance of your team.
