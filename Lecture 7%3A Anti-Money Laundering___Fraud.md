						- The fraudster might advertiseÂ that they can place an order via a stolen Grubhub account. But the crooks want 20% of the total order value to provide this service.
						- The consumer shopping for the "deal" then orders $100 worth of food from a local restaurant and then pays the fraudster say $20 in cryptocurrency.
						- The discount diner who is ordering the kung pao chicken dumplings or steak and cheese sandwiches at a great price pays a fraction of the value of the food ordered.
						- The fraudster then orders the food and pays $100 to Grubhub using the credit card on file in the stolen account.
						- The fraudster often uses another consumer's credit card that's on file in a food delivery app â€”Â information that the crooks have on hand â€”Â to make the purchase and ding that cardÂ to pick up the rest of the cost for your low-budget, OK, let's make that stolen, meal.

				- How the scam works.
					- You search for your favorite restaurantâ€™s website to see if they offer delivery and a way to order online. Near the top of the search results, you find a website that looks like it belongs to the restaurant. Or you may find a third-party website that looks very professional and similar to popular services likeÂ [DoorDash](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-francisco/profile/food-delivery/doordash-1116-545841)Â orÂ [GrubHub](https://www.bbb.org/us/il/chicago/profile/food-delivery/grubhub-0654-88362004).
					- You click on the link, select your food, and enter your credit card information to pay. Charges appear on your account, but the food never arrives. When you call the restaurant to see whatâ€™s happened, they are unaware of your order. The website was a fake, and now the scammers have your credit card information, address, and other personal details.
