								- > Badges are awarded to mentees by employees already proficient as, say, a “rookie writer” (someone with limited permissions who can respond to customer-facing e-mails in times of need) or a “GlassFrog genius” (someone with a thorough understanding of the holacracy software).
							- Karl at ARCA, a law school graduate
								- Taking roles he excelles more
								  collapsed:: true
									- > Take Karl, who came to ARCA before it implemented holacracy. A recent law school graduate, he had little business experience but showed great potential with his legal and analytical skills.
									- > His versatility allowed him to take on multiple roles at the growing company, in sales, legal services, and operations. However, as he worked across functional groups, he felt his contributions were getting lost in the organizational structure.
									- >When the company adopted holacracy, Karl’s many roles across multiple circles became explicit and visible. He thought his value was more clearly recognized, which gave him even more confidence to initiate changes and make decisions. Karl said, “Pre-holacracy, I felt pretty empowered but always ran stuff by people. I think an org implementing holacracy is saying, ‘You don’t have to run stuff by us anymore.’ I’ve taken the opportunity to exercise more judgment and discretion.”
									- > As one of his peers noted a few months into the new system, “Holacracy has really expanded his influence in the company.”
								- Decreasing of what he does not excel in
								  collapsed:: true
									- > Holacracy let him jettison roles that weren’t a good use of his time. For instance, he used the structuring process to carve out some administrative responsibilities and pitch them as a separate role, which the lead link filled with an enthusiastic new hire. Although this shift in responsibilities was initiated by an individual contributor, not by a manager, it was highly formalized and official.

						  collapsed:: true

					- Complicates actually doing the work: Since now there are more tasks **Roles * Responsibilities**
						- Explanation
						  collapsed:: true
							- > First, it complicates actually doing the work, because employees struggle with fragmentation. A significant body of literature on goal setting (aptly summarized by Marc Effron and Miriam Ort in their book One Page Talent Management) finds that employees perform less well on each goal as they take on more beyond just a handful. At Zappos, each of the 7.4 roles an individual fills contains an average of 3.47 distinct responsibilities, resulting in more than 25 responsibilities per employee.
						- People struggle
							- where to focus their attention
							- how to prioritize
							- how to coordinate across circles—even with simple scheduling issues
						- [[Zappos]] is trying out a tool: [[People Points]]
							- > Each circle gets a certain number of points with which to recruit individuals into roles, with senior management determining the points by assessing the business value of the circle’s work
							- (The company is exploring crowdfunding models to replace this top-down budgeting.)

					- Complicates [[compensation]] #[[employee evaluation]]
					- Complicates [[hiring]]
						- [[Zappos]] developed a [[Role Marketpalce]]
							- >Zappos’s roughly 1,500 employees made and received 17,624 role assignments (11.7 per employee), or about 195 per day. Given that volume, the company developed Role Marketplace, a tool to quickly post open roles and manage applications, with lead links ultimately deciding who fills the roles. The tool handled almost a quarter of those 17,624 assignments

				- Example
					- At a more structural level, a political party might be set up to bring about social reform in a society but ends up primarily as a vehicle to give careers to the politicians who run the party.
				- **A very interesting example**: A man aspired to run own IT company. But he was reluctant to leave the comfort of the company.
				  collapsed:: true
					- > similar process is occurring when managers in an organisation build personal ‘empires’ that serve their own private purposes more than they serve corporate ends of achieving long-term organisational survival. An example of this was the head of computing services of a large financial services company. What this man really aspired to was running his own information technology company. But he was reluctant to leave the comfort of the company with which he had spent most of his career and which paid him a large salary with an excellent pension scheme and a cheap mortgage. Consequently, he built up his department with experts in every branch of computing and information technology – often when that expertise was of little relevance to the main business. This man persuaded the chief executive that all this was necessary to ‘cope with the future’. But eventually the cost burden of the department became too great in the eyes of the board of directors. The IT man was removed with half of his staff with the consequence that the costs fell dramatically and the computing and IT service improved considerably. The IT function had been subverting the ends for which it was set up.

						- To drive efficient org as they possible can. WIth least waste.

				- Why nothing was put into the suggestion box?

				- What the management things motivates people? #verified

						- 💪 If they did a suggestion, they would make them do more or fire somebody. #verified
							- [[Soldiering]]

						  id:: 65d8a781-8b55-494d-877e-2bc37c3e2862
							- *Rules are dead, people are alive*
								- People writing these rules don't know whats going on.
				- From mangement POV
					- Assumptions
						- **TLDR**: Factory should be like a prescize machine
						- Highly intelligent Engineers made better processes that uneducated line workers could ever make.
						- Line workers are bad at obeying.
						- If they don't follow the suggestions they do that because they are lazy.
							- Her goal to have extra time for practicing english by doing things in a easier way is unproductive.
						- The managers assume that the mangers directly above them will take the suggestion to them.
							- So they is nothing to clear out, worry with the lowest level workers
								- Everything they are doing is disobedient
						- Workers tend be naturally unproductive.
						- Workers are motivated by only by money #verified
						- Each worker is replacable #verified
							- They are commoditized
							- Its not that they have value in themselves
							- *you store them next in dormitories like commodities*
						- workers should function like machines do #verified
					- How would describe thje factory
						- its a machine. A visual machine
					- Everyone knows exatcly where they have to be
						- Everything is synchronized
					- Explicit vs Implicit assumptipns.
						- Workers know nothing, but we have a suggestion box.
					-
			- Principles
				- **Elimination of waste.**
				- **Zero defects**
				- **Just-in-time (JIT)**
				- **Pull instead of push**
					- most businesses use a combination of pull and push processes, called a hybrid or "push-pull" system
						- The "push-pull" boundary, also known as the "d**ecoupling point"**, can be set at different stages of production based on various factors such as lead time, production flexibility, and customer service level.
				- **“Kaizen” or continuous improvement**
			- Visual Factory
				- Transparency
			- Kaizen
				- > But one of the things we have observed is that things steadily improve while we are on-site, but as soon as everyone goes home, things slip back to where they were.
