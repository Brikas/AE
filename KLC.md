				  background-color:: purple
				  collapsed:: true
					- **Teams are the structure.**
					  background-color:: blue
						- Within them, individual “roles” are collectively defined and assigned to accomplish the work.
						- In holacracy, they’re “circles”; in podularity, “pods”; at [[Valve]], “cabals”; and at many companies, simply “teams.”
						- After Zappos implemented holacracy, 150 departmental units evolved into 500 circles.
						- **Modularity** #[[corporate modularity]]
							- allows for more plug-and-play activity across the enterprise
							- the teams **come and go** as employees perceive changes in the organization’s needs
								- (just as task forces and project teams in traditional organizations do, but **without the surrounding [[matrix structure]]**, which **has a way of holding ad hoc groups together** even after **they’re irrelevant**).
							- People usually hold multiple roles, on various teams
					- **Teams design and govern themselves**
					  background-color:: blue
						- while nested within a larger structure.
						- organizations ratify a **constitution**—a living document
							- The constitution doesn’t say how people should do their tasks.

								  collapsed:: true

									- > His versatility allowed him to take on multiple roles at the growing company, in sales, legal services, and operations. However, as he worked across functional groups, he felt his contributions were getting lost in the organizational structure.
									- >When the company adopted holacracy, Karl’s many roles across multiple circles became explicit and visible. He thought his value was more clearly recognized, which gave him even more confidence to initiate changes and make decisions. Karl said, “Pre-holacracy, I felt pretty empowered but always ran stuff by people. I think an org implementing holacracy is saying, ‘You don’t have to run stuff by us anymore.’ I’ve taken the opportunity to exercise more judgment and discretion.”

								  collapsed:: true
									- > Holacracy let him jettison roles that weren’t a good use of his time. For instance, he used the structuring process to carve out some administrative responsibilities and pitch them as a separate role, which the lead link filled with an enthusiastic new hire. Although this shift in responsibilities was initiated by an individual contributor, not by a manager, it was highly formalized and official.

					- Complicates actually doing the work: Since now there are more tasks **Roles * Responsibilities**
						- Explanation
						  collapsed:: true
							- > First, it complicates actually doing the work, because employees struggle with fragmentation. A significant body of literature on goal setting (aptly summarized by Marc Effron and Miriam Ort in their book One Page Talent Management) finds that employees perform less well on each goal as they take on more beyond just a handful. At Zappos, each of the 7.4 roles an individual fills contains an average of 3.47 distinct responsibilities, resulting in more than 25 responsibilities per employee.
						- People struggle
							- where to focus their attention
							- how to prioritize
							- how to coordinate across circles—even with simple scheduling issues
						- [[Zappos]] is trying out a tool: [[People Points]]
							- > Each circle gets a certain number of points with which to recruit individuals into roles, with senior management determining the points by assessing the business value of the circle’s work
							- (The company is exploring crowdfunding models to replace this top-down budgeting.)

					- Complicates [[compensation]] #[[employee evaluation]]
					- Complicates [[hiring]]
						- [[Zappos]] developed a [[Role Marketpalce]]
							- >Zappos’s roughly 1,500 employees made and received 17,624 role assignments (11.7 per employee), or about 195 per day. Given that volume, the company developed Role Marketplace, a tool to quickly post open roles and manage applications, with lead links ultimately deciding who fills the roles. The tool handled almost a quarter of those 17,624 assignments

						- There was a growing view that, if Valve was going to make a meaningful dent in the hardware space, they **needed to make a significant commitment** to [hire]([[hiring]]) hardware experts as full-time employees.

						- In hardware, it’s much harder to have something be fluid.”
							- hardware production was marked by long lead times, requiring specifications to be fixed long in advance of release. Coomer reflected, “In our model, it’s really hard for us to have things fixed. We don’t think that way. Why would we stop designing if we can continue to improve it?
