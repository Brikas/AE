- **interview-based procedure**
	- **(1) Interview**: RPAs are engaged with open-ended questions derived from psychological scales to elicit RPAs‚Äô mindsets and behaviors.
	- üî∏ **(2) Assessment**: We utilize LLMs to interpret the responses collected from the first stage. This can involve converting the responses to Likert levels or using LLMs to simulate a psychiatrist‚Äôs role in judging RPA personalities.
		- **Method 1:** Option Conversion (OC)
		  collapsed:: true
			- dimensional-specific option conversion (d-OC) strategy
				- Likert levels, such as ‚Äú4 (Agree)‚Äù and ‚Äú2 (Disagree)‚Äù, with more descriptive options like ‚Äú4 (Extroverted)‚Äù and ‚Äú2 (Introverted)‚Äù in the prompts for LLMs.
			- ```
			  I have conducted many conversations with {character name}. I will input a dict of many samples, where each sample consists of a statement and a conversation. Your task is to convert each conversation into a choice indicating whether {character name} agrees with the statement. You should output a dict, where the keys are the same as the input dict, and the values are the choices. ===OUTPUT FORMAT===
			  {
			  "<i start>": <choice 1>, ... "<i end>": <choice n>
			  }
			  ===CHOICE INSTRUCTION===
			  ```
			- Choice Instruction of OC (BFI)
				- ```
				  Each choice is a number from 1 to 5. Please evaluate <character> based on the conversation using the scales: 1 denotes ‚Äôstrongly disagree‚Äô 2 denotes ‚Äôa little disagree‚Äô, 3 denotes ‚Äôneither agree nor disagree‚Äô, 4 denotes ‚Äôlittle agree‚Äô, and 5 denotes ‚Äôstrongly agree‚Äô. In case <character> refuses to answer the question, use "x" to indicate it.

			  You are an expert in Psychometrics, especially {scale name}. I am conducting the {scale name} test on someone. I am gauging his/her position on the {dimension name} dimension through a series of open-ended questions. For clarity, here‚Äôs some background this particular dimension:
			  ===
			  {dimension description}
			  ===
			  My name is {experimenter name}. I‚Äôve invited a participant, {character name}, and we had many conversations in {language}. I will input the conversations.
			  Please help me assess {character name}‚Äôs score within the {dimension name} dimension of {scale name}.
			  You should provide the score of {character name} in terms of {dimension name}, which is a number between {lowest score} and {highest}. {lowest score} denotes ‚Äônot {dimension name} at all‚Äô, {middle score} denotes ‚Äôneutral‚Äô, and {highest score} denotes ‚Äôstrongly {dimension name}‚Äô. Other numbers in this range represent different degrees of ‚Äô{dimension name}‚Äô. Please output in the following json format: === {{ "analysis": <your analysis based on the conversations>, "result": <your score> }}

	- > Then, we invite human annotators for comprehensive personality labels on all 14 scales.
		- To select qualified annotators, we examine their character understanding of the BFI and 16P, matching with labels from the PDb.
	- We invite two to three annotators for each character (93 in total for 32 characters)
- Metrics
	- **[[Measured alignment (MA)]]** - compares the measured personalities of RPAs and human-annotated personalities of characters.
	- **[[Personality consistency (PC)]]** - indicates whether the measured personality of RPAs is consistent across various settings.
- Findings
	- ((65ff22d2-fd33-426e-b0a4-65f660631043)) is better
