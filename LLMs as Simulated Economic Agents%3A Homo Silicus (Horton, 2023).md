	- 🔸 **Status Quo bias in decision-making**: Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) #framing
	  collapsed:: true
		- This paper introduced the term status quo bias and demonstrated in several decision scenarios that when an option was presented as the status quo, it was more likely to be selected.

	- The main conclusion is that **this approach seems promising**: it can qualitatively re-cover findings from experiments with actual humans.

	- LLMs - implicit computational models of humans
	- From abstract
	  collapsed:: true
		- > LLMs could allow researchers to pilot studies via simulation first, searching for novel social science insights to test in the real world.
	- *But ultimately, what will matter in practice is whether these AI experiments are practically valuable for generating insights.*
	- *As such, what is the value of these experiments? The most obvious use is to __pilot experiments in silico first to gain insights__ . They could cheaply and easily explore the parameter space, test whether behaviors seem sen- sitive to the precise wording of various questions, and generate data that will “look like” the actual data.*
		- *the primary use of homo silicus experiments is to __simulate experiments before trying them in the real world,__ and this method is adopted.*

  collapsed:: true
	- > The above is a non-technical description of LLMs, which raises the question of whether a deeper understanding is needed. **I would argue not**. To do economics—even behavioral economics—we do not have to study neurons and parts of the brain.
	- id:: 65eccb0a-1363-4672-8032-5e8612220531
	  > But even if the corpus is carefully curated, the worry is that homo silicus is informed not by “humans in general” but the **highly selected pool of** “humans creating public writing, and then selected again what they choose to say.”
	- *And economists have historically taken a dim view of the economic content of __mere statements rather than behaviors__. This would seem to be a damning critique of a model literally trained on statements.*
