- Proposal
	- Stuffs
	  collapsed:: true
		- Hi Daniel,
		- **Project Proposal** - LLMs driven simulations x market research
		- We have discussed the topic last week and it seemed that we are quite align on the topic, direction and potential methods of study. So this email will include a summary of what we discussed, some additional input, abstract roadmap we have and next steps.
		- Summary
			- **Theme**: Testing the potential of systematically applying large language models to simulate market research activities.
			- **Why research this?**:
			  collapsed:: true
				- We realize that LLM training data includes product, features reviews, feedback.
				- We also realize that LLM agents can be given a role, which as existing academic research suggests, shows well documented economic behavior.
					- ([Brand et. al., 2023)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4395751) - Using GPT for Market Research
					- [(Park et. al., 2023)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586183.3606763) - Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior
				- From our DM program we learned that some practices of innovation, market research, entrepreneurship have monetary and time costs.
				- We are interested in the potential of LLM agents to simulate market research activities.
				- A successful outcome can have almost immediate practical implications in assistant innovation, entrepreneurship, marketing practices.
			- **Concept and roadmap**
				- Find and select a market research system/method.
				- Find a way to systematically encode a human persona into a text prompt.
				- Find a way to systematically encode a representation of a feature, product, etc. into a text prompt
				- Develop a systematic method to simulate a market research practice with LLM's
				- Find or create real market research data
				- Benchmark simulated method with real data
				- Draw conclusions and understanding about the use of LLM's to simulate market research
				- Some notes
					- We do not train our own language model. We utilize existing, highly rated LLM's
					- We do not use LLM's as 'helpful assistants', we use them as agents with inscribed personas that virtually participate in market research activity
			- **Why us?**
				- As a team, me and Elias have the cross-disciplinary capabilities in data science, entrepreneurship and market research.
				- We have already experimented with open-source models, OpenAI API interfaces and are very comfortable using LLM's with programming languages.
				- We have plenty of industry connection with various market research practitioners and have the entrepreneurial fervor to build a convincing case out of it.
			- **Potential LLMs choices**
				- Open-source, such as Mistral 8x7b
				- Proprietary, such as Mistral Medium, GPT3.5 or GPT4 (depends on budget)
			- **Potential Market Research activity integrations**
				- Focus groups
				- Conjoint analyses
				- Simpler alternative: Feedback on products, services & features
			- **Potential empirical methods / ways to benchmark**
				- Conducting our own focus groups (or conjoint analyses)
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- This seems quite realistic.
					- Our research can have great potential for product managers & startup entrepreneurs
					- We are ready to CSE (Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship), DTU Skylab and talk with connections directly, to see if we could collaborate on a focus group.
					- Potentially we can even make a few.
				- Online data
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- 1000 IRL people with characteristics and answers
					- Real people Social Media content to build agent profiles
					- Public product feedback on site lite product hunt, reddit, hacker news.
				- Existing market research with replication data
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Query "focus group", "market research", "conjoint analysis"
					- Search on Google Dataset Search, Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository
					- See if we can replicate results with an LLM simulation
				- Manual Assessment
				  logseq.order-list-type:: number
					- Interview a professional(s) in the field that does market research.
						- Understanding requirements, challenges.
					- Create a simulated version
					- Use the same professional(s) as a tester for the solution and ask for an evaluation.
			- **Acknowledged risks and challenges**
				- Highly dynamic front of innovation, where existing research may be limited.
				- Highly dynamic front of innovation, where the utility of our discoveries/knowledge may diminish fast.
				- Outputs of the LLM's can be unexpectedly prompt sensitive, which creates a potential pitfalls and can impact consistency
				- It might be difficult to reduce/isolate the number of general variables.
				- We are aware that due to the cross-disciplinary approach, the bachelor project may be required by CBS standards and your study interests to pivot heavier on a particular discipline (we had this feedback from another professor, yet we are unsure how this affects us)
			- **Next Steps (2-3 weeks)**
				- Explore additional existing research of LLMs around this topic
				- Select and revise a market research method
				- Select way to gather real data
				- Ideate (or select) the techniques/frameworks of encoding a human persona into a text prompt.
				- Ideate (or select) the techniques/frameworks of encoding a representation of a feature, product, etc. into a text prompt
				- Ideate on the overall system of simulating the market research activity
				- Align with you again (or throughout), to conclude progress on methodology and determine next steps

				- Challenges
					- Proving is viable only if there is very limited scope of variety
			- Ideas 3
				- Interview people who do that for a living. Ask what chalelnges and requirements are. See if you can meet them with LLMs
				- Use them as testers. Let them intereact.
				- We should try to narrow it down.
			- Reflections
			  collapsed:: true
				- He is thinking too much in categories
				- He is an Academic, we, atleast me are not.
				- Talk to Daniel about this cross-disciplinary thing.
