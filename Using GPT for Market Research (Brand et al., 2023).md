		- > GPT‚Äôs training data includes information from numerous sources on the internet, which may include product reviews, messaging boards, and other online forums with contributions from a wide range of consumers discussing the products they shop for and purchase.
		- > these components suggest that GPT may be an invaluable source of insight into consumer preferences due to its ability to mimic or replicate human responses.
		- > Existing tools for market research, such as conjoint studies, focus groups, and proprietary data sets can be expensive. If LLMs can generate responses that are consistent with existing studies on human subjects, then they may also be able to serve as a fast and low-cost method of providing the information typically generated by conjoint studies and other customer surveys.

			- > As major tech companies have begun to combine LLMs with tools for searching and synthesizing information from the web, one might imagine using LLMs to develop marketing or pricing strategies prior to the launch of a new product, and then iteratively querying LLMs over time to evaluate product-market fit and modify the marketing strategy.
		- > Hence, our approach to performing market research using GPT is to treat the model as a synthetic consumer rather than a source of knowledge.

			- Market research concerns not only what customers will say about their preferences, but what their choices reveal about those underlying preferences when economic models are estimated using the resulting data. Analysis of the latter involves **subjecting humans to multiple questions** with **different contexts**, and requires humans to behave in ways that are, for the most part, **internally consistent**.

		- state dependence
			- serial correlation in customers‚Äô choices
				- for example, In health insurance markets inertia drives patients to **repeatedly choose the same plan even when the plan‚Äôs attributes change significantly** (e.g., Handel, 2013; Pakes et al., 2021).
			- Aligns with the theory mentioned in papers. Self made data
		- diminishing marginal utility of wealth
	- Realism of GPT‚Äôs responses is similar to ones found in real surveys
		- [[Willingness-to-Pay (WTP)]]
		- Resulting [[WTP]] estimates seem realistic, both in magnitudes and in distribution.
		- a [conjoint]([[conjoint analysis]])-like approach to preference estimation yields results that are **strikingly similar** to those found in a recent survey of real consumers conducted by Fong et al. (2023).
