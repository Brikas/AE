				- Decisions in a week
				- Low money
					- But then, government subsidized wellbeing initiatives.
					-
			- Scale-ups 100 - 250
			- Established 250 - 1500
			- Big enterprises
				- Takes 1.5 year to close.
					- Too slow.
					- Therefore they downsized
				- Like Nestle.
		- No matter which category, the employees had the same need to use the product.
		- Its faster to close with smaller companies.

		- Last year raised first round.
			- 4 angels and 1 VC
				- VCs do the due dilligence, so the angels don't bother with too many questions, they trust the VC.

			- Don't just fall under the blocks of being a pitcher.
			- ðŸ”¹ðŸ”¸ Humble approach
				- "We are going to raise our first round. We are **new to this**. But we would **love your help**, because **you are really good** at assessing companies and building investment rounds. We would love some **sparring with you** - hear your thoughts how could be **improve our decks**, how could we build our funding round."
				- Then it becomes more like a 
				   collaboration approach. Instead of saying yes or no, they help you.
				- And perhaps they also invest.
				- Its less transactioan, you are building a relationship.
		- There is a huge difference in investors, regarding how much they would help.
		- ðŸ”¸ You have to meet a lot of investors. Its **time-consuming**. 60 - 70% of your time will be raising money.
			- Not just piching time.
			- Also time finding data, answers to their questions.
		- ðŸ”¸ **Trap** of spending more time **making the project look good** instead of making it be good.
