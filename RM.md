					- *Some notes*
					  collapsed:: true
						- Passion is implicit. Its not not written explicitly.
						- In qualitative methods, you can't taker yourself out of the equation.
			- **Falsifiable**
				- Every attempted solution, every theory, is tested as rigorously as it is possible for us to test it.
				- Our testing of theories is also an attempt to detect their weaknesses. The testing of a theory is thus an attempt to refute or to falsify the theory
				- TODO Example
			- **The demarcation problem**
				- How do we distinguish “empirical scientific problems” from “other theories”?
				- What is empirical science and is not?
					- Real ones are the ones that can tested
				- What are real theories?
					- The ones that can be tested

	- From problems to [[Research Questions]]
		- (Bryman, 2007, p. 6)
			- The might be other roles of research question other than structuring you enquiry.
			- What the role of the research question is?
		- **Some rules of thumb when composing research questions**
			- You need to think about the scope of the RQ.
			  background-color:: green
			  collapsed:: true
				- Is this even possible within the scope of, for example, a Bachelor’s thesis?
				- Will I/we be able to collect and analyze the data required to answer the question?
			- Consider prior research when writing your RQ.
			  background-color:: green
			  collapsed:: true
				- How is this an extension of or correction to existing research in the field? (this require some kind of literature review.)
				- The RQ needs to be positioned and situated in the research field.
			- Be explicit about the object of study.
			  background-color:: green
			  collapsed:: true
				- if you are doing a case study (we will return to cases in lecture 8) then make it explicit in the RQ.
			- Think about whether your RQ should be descriptive, comparative, correlational, exploratory, etc.
			  background-color:: green
			  collapsed:: true
				- **Descriptive:**
					- How do graphic designers at firm x incorporate AI software services such as Dall-E and Midjourney in their daily work practices?
				- **Correlational:**
					- What is the relationship between the US Bureau of Labor Statistics releases of unemployment numbers and the price of the S&P500?
				- **Comparative:**
					- What is the difference in perceptions towards Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) in OECD countries with high levels of trust in their governments and countries with low levels of trust in their governments?
				- **Exploratory:**
					- What are the effects of mobile phone-free school experiments in Danish elementary schools on the learning and mental welfare of students?
			- The kicker: You write it in the beginning but revise it at the end!

	- The issue of replacement of while collar workers with AI
		- How would you adress with the perspective of ((65c0e823-2d6f-4431-bd63-77ba1978fc26))?
			- Find a setting
				- What are the industries with highest intakes of AI?
			- Find the extent of a problem in a setting
				-
			- Solving the solution
				- Potential
					- Legislation/regulation
- Lecture 3
	- Let's assume and then test
	- Let's not assume and then test
	- Thought experiment - **Call**: What are you voting for?
		- Assumptions
			- Intention
				- Assumption that what you say somehow connects with future action.
			- Representation
				- There is an assumption that by asking a sample you will be able to describe that will be representative.
		- Contenxt Specifity
			- There is Democracy
			- It is allowed by privacy
			- Some level of Honesty / Truth
		- **Conclusions**: Anytime you are doing research, you need to identify your assumptions.
	- Stuff
		- Parts
		  collapsed:: true
			- To Explore,
				- usually more in a new science
					- Like at first they observed the stars in cosmos.
			- To Understand,
			- To Describe,
			- To Demonstrate,
			- To Test
				- usually more in older sciences
					- like medicine - we know a lot about humans
				- There is usually control
				-
		- About parts
			- Does not neccessiily in the black box
			- So for LLM it is not neccessarily wrong to demonstrate before understanding
				- This is where research opinions come in.
	- Competence
		- Neo-liberal capitalism
		- Structural Incompetence
			- The current economy makes us incompetent in managing our lives.
			- *The example of her miscarriage.*
	- Sociology
		- *Individual identifying things*
		- Sociological identity categories
	- Culture - anthropology
		- 2/3 things demons and angels are common with us. 1/5 receive answer to direct prayer requesst once a week.
			- 2/3 makes it safe to say that its men and women, thats its not exclusive to any class.
		- Values
			- People have values
		- Meaning-making
			- People have a common understranding what is real, what things mean.
		- F.e. description of evangelical christianity
			- decriptionn of cultural reality
			- they learn and train their mind to interprety things as divine, religious, acts of god.
		- f.e. testing
			- whether a capacity towards absorption gives you a relationship to god.
		- How do I know if I have a cultural / psychological angle?
			- Interested in mind with notable properties.
			- Patterns of things in the brain
	- **Idea**: when you have a question aboout tmsht, you have to think what kind of facet are you studying?
		- What is the basic thing that you think exists in the world that you are studying?
		- Why? So you an pick the right methods.
			- f.e. anthropolists tend to do field work.
	- Data
		- Observations
		- Ethnographic interviews
		- **Beef**: difference between individual response and culture data
			- **Individual response**
				- needs a **random** sample'
					- Random sample is hard to get.
				- Psychlogical phemonema, social groups
			- **Culture data**
				- Does not require a random sample
					- You tent to hit saturation fairly quickly
				- values, common sense, meaning
				- Smoking example
					- To have an easier reason to take a break during a concert or social interaction
					- To force oneself to have breaks to reflect
					- To dont feel excluded from peers who smoke
					- To enjoy the taste
					- To have an euphoric nicotine high.
