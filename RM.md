			- Dumstering
				- > She uses a loading pallet as a ladder to climb into the dumpster. Dressed in her clean green and yellow striped angora sweater and a pair of nicely tailored dark slacks, she dons rubber gloves and immediately gets to work while Carter, eager to start hitting licks with the approach of nightfall, waits impatiently in the Chinook.
				  While shifting through the garbage, she tells me, “I’ve gotten so much shit out of here, Jeff. Last week, I found meat—ten little-bitty cans of the pretty, pretty golden hams. I gave them to Hank to sell.”
				  Tonight’s garbage is bountiful. She pulls out a large plastic bucket of Charms lollipops, several flats of Otis Spunkmeyer wild blueberry muffins, one flat of poppyseed muffins, a flat of Hawaiian Punch Tropical Fruit flavored soda, a half-empty extra-large bottle of Excedrin, several cans of Lysol, a box of lightbulbs, an enormous bag of chocolate chips, and a bag of pistachio nuts.
			- **Hustling**: Carter and Tina engage in hustling, which involves a mix of opportunistic theft (or "licks"), low-level drug dealing, and other activities like selling clothing acquired through credit card fraud (pp. 5–7, 11–12).
				- > When full darkness finally sets in, Carter drives us to the waterfront where the most active warehouses are located. Spying an open shipping container, he jerks the Chinook to a stop and runs to check it but returns shaking his head, “Empty.” He repeats this two more times before he decides that the port must be closed this week because of some change in international shipping patterns.
			- **Petty theft and shoplifting**: These are recurring strategies for obtaining goods to sell or for personal use. For example, Carter shoplifts T-shirts (p. 8) and plans theft from construction sites (pp. 20–21, 30).
				- > Energized both by crack and by the pleasure of being back out on the street with Tina, Carter talks nonstop. He quickly changes the subject away from his failed attempt to “go clean” and shows me two “I San Francisco” t-shirts that he has just shoplifted in the Fisherman’s Wharf tourist district.
			- **Pawning stolen materials**: The couple earns money by selling stolen items, such as plywood or items from construction sites, to secondhand stores or scrapyards for cash (pp. 14, 21–22, 30).
				- > They are planning another lick because they have had no luck today, and they have only three dollars remaining from the five sheets of plywood they sold yesterday to the used lumber depot.
			- **Panhandling and Window washing**: Tina engages in panhandling and washing car windshields for spare change, which contribute to their income (pp. 9–10, 15).
				- > They figure they can persuade Sal to sell them a bag “two dollars short,” so they need only four more dollars “to get well.” Tina agrees to hustle up that amount washing windshields, but they start arguing when Carter insists on “holding the four dollars” they already have until she returns.
			- **Credit card fraud**: The pair uses stolen credit cards to purchase items for resale or personal use (p. 5).
				-
			- **Recycling**: Collecting cardboard, cans, and other recyclables can be resold for small amounts of money (p. 9).
			- **Benefiting from the kindness of strangers**: Occasionally they receive money for small acts of assistance, such as helping to jump-start a car (pp. 4–5).
			- **Temporary employment**: There are short stints of legal employment, such as Tina working part-time at Kentucky Fried Chicken (pp. 27–28).
			- **Drug sales**: While Tina's son Ricky provides Tina with a small quantity of crack to sell, Carter resists engaging more deeply in drug sales, fearing the associated risks and potential for violence (pp. 25–26).
			- **Bin-diving/Dumpster diving**: Searching through dumpsters sometimes yields valuable items that can be used or sold (p. 9).
			- **Credit from drug dealers**: Tina manages to acquire drugs on 'credit,' implying some trust or arrangement with her suppliers, allowing them to maintain their habit and possibly resell some portion (pp. 12–13).
