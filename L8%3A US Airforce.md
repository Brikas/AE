	- Qs
	  collapsed:: true
		- Why did F-15 pilots see what they saw?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- They knew no helicopters should be there at this time.
				- Thereâ€™d been no mention of helicopters in his flight plan
			- The visual appearance of it was different from training
				- becaue they were not used to identified from that perspective
			- They were trigger-happy. Hunger for fight.
			- IFF didn't intervene
			- AWACS did not intervene
			- Nothing enters the no flight zone before they do.
			- The senior f-15 fighter identifying first gave extra confirmation bias
		- .Why did no one in the AWACS intervene?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- They misbehaved previously, by not knowing the destination location. (didn't know the code)
				- so did want to appear incopetent
				- ((66193670-fb7f-483b-a463-8364e6bef148))
			- Limited information
				- why?
					- idea of MinimumCommunication
			- A controller would not disagree with a superior Pilot.
			- AWACS controller was new
				- he was assuming that people was piggy-backing what he was doing.
			- Tired crew
			- *it wasn't an A team*
			- Adherance towards SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)
			- Confirmation bias to that it should have been a very easy day.
			  id:: 66193670-fb7f-483b-a463-8364e6bef148
			- broken panel
			- changing radio frequencies
				- so all the comms from helis had to be middle-manned by the AWACS
			- *Overall*

		- What are the root causes of the shootdown?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Overall
				- There are multiple factors
			- Failed ID
			- the helicopter should not fly there strategically
			- Helicopters are not recognized as air-crafts
				- Mistalignment of definitions
			- bad change management.
			- Army and Airforce codes were not synchronized.
				- lack of comms betrween the Army and Airforce
			- The military was pulling crew members from all over the globe for temporary assignments and expecting them to function in the field as integrated teams.
			- Everyone and nobody was formally in charge.
			- Army and AirForce tension
				- lead to IFF malfucntion
				- bad turnout of competition over resources
			- Inexperienced crew
			- Fake sense of security
			- Not checking where the route was
			- At this time, its peace and the AirForce was getting body cuts, it was fatigued,
				- The organization was not ready for it.
			- It can be framed for political
		- Whom would you hold accountable? Why?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Real
				- Pilots were not blamed
				- Wilson was court marshaled but aqquited.
					- He should not be flying at all cause he had isomnia
