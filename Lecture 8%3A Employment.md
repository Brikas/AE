  background-color:: yellow
  collapsed:: true
	- **Classification of Workers:**
		- Consider carefully how you classify your labor actors. Misclassification can result in liabilities and legal action. Courts may look beyond written contracts to the actual nature of the relationship. Avoid structures where you control workers in a way that signifies traditional employment.
	- **Regulatory Environment:**
		- Keep track of the changing regulatory environment. Some regions like the EU are willing to look beyond the contract and are updating laws to account for new business models seen in the gig and platform economies.
	- **Algorithm-driven Management:**
		- Understand and mitigate risks of running an algorithm-driven platform. This could lead to constraints on workers' autonomy and potentially create a power dynamic similar to traditional employment.
		- You must also disclose all ((656e44fe-a988-46c4-b155-f02602adf78f))
	- *Alternative/Innovative*
		- **Pricing Models:**
			- Be aware of the implications of your pricing structures. If prices are algorithmically determined and subject to labor supply, this could impact workersâ€™ earnings significantly and breed dissatisfaction.
		- **Tools Ownership:**
			- Business models relying heavily on the platform (app/website) owned by the company could be seen as hinting towards 'employment' status of workers as the company owns critical 'assets.'
		- **Control and Autonomy:**
			- If strategizing to pass more autonomy to workers, ensure it is substantive and not just derivative, or still within your control.
		- **Substitutional Policy:**
			- The policy about whether workers can substitute themselves can impact their classification. Policies should be made carefully and considered under regional laws.
		- **Protection of Workers:** #differentiation #USP
			- Ensure adequate protections for your labor actors - consider benefits, insurances, work conditions, especially in case of unseen events like a pandemic. Workers' satisfaction can significantly impact your business.
	- **Legal Advice:**
		- Always get appropriate legal advice when strategy planning, the law varies significantly from region to region, and having local legal advice is key to ensuring you're compliant with all regulations.

						- Had the latter part of Article 7:659 not been included, i.e. the wording would simply have been â€œA worker has the obligation to perform work personallyâ€™, the Dutch case may have reached a different outcome, as in such a hypothetical case there would have been at least one element which would have been incompatible with an employment relationship. Whilst at present, there were four indicators of an employment contract and one that may indicate against it, albeit not in an incompatible manner, thereby leading the Court to find that there was indeed an employment contract (Rechtbank Amsterdam, 2019: par. 3.12.1.).
