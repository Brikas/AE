		- **Shareholders agreements** and **Founder Agreements**
		  collapsed:: true
			- 🔸 *Shareholders’ agreements, including founders’ agreements, usually have no binding effect on the company or on resolutions passed by the shareholders in a general meeting*
				- Explanation
					- **Not Binding on the Company**
						- The company is considered a separate legal entity from its shareholders. So, if the shareholders agree on something in the shareholders' agreement, it d**oesn't automatically become a legal obligation for the company**.
						- Long Example
						  collapsed:: true
							- Imagine a startup company called "Tech Innovators Inc." with three shareholders: Alice, Bob, and Carol. They each own an equal share of the company (33.33% each). They decide to create a shareholders' agreement to outline certain arrangements.
							  
							  In their shareholders' agreement, they specify a profit-sharing arrangement. According to this agreement, profits will be distributed as follows:
							  
							  Alice: 40%
							  Bob: 30%
							  Carol: 30%
							  This agreement is signed by all three shareholders and becomes a legally binding contract between them.
							  
							  Now, let's say Tech Innovators Inc. has a highly successful year and generates $100,000 in profits. According to the shareholders' agreement, the profit distribution would be:
							  
							  Alice: $40,000 (40% of $100,000)
							  Bob: $30,000 (30% of $100,000)
							  Carol: $30,000 (30% of $100,000)
							  However, let's say the company's board of directors, which may include individuals who aren't shareholders (or even other shareholders not party to the original agreement), decides that the company needs to reinvest all of its profits back into the business for growth. This decision might be made for various reasons, such as expansion, R&D, or paying off debts.
							  
							  In this case, despite the profit-sharing arrangement specified in the shareholders' agreement, the company is not legally bound to follow it. The board's decision to reinvest the profits for growth takes precedence.

Wahts the point then?

				- 🔸 Extract
					- The DPC initially accepted WhatsApp’s arguments that the lossy hashes did not amount to personal data. However, the EDPB directed the DPC to conclude that the **lossy hashes** did **amount to personal data**. Again, EDPB underlined that the motivation was an irrelevant factor (p.38). The EDPB also concluded that WhatsApp relied too heavily on the argument that the **lossy-hashes did not relate to a specific phone number and, instead, indicated 16phone numbers.** The EDPB noted that anonymisation depends on preventing singling out, inference and linking and the technique used by WhatsApp (**k-anonymisation**) only avoids singling out, but **does not prevent inference or linkability**. Further the EDPB concluded that WhatsApp overstated the effectiveness of the technique even so far as singling out was concerned, as WhatsApp looked at the total number of possible phone numbers in determining the value of k, whereas it should have looked at the actual number of phone numbers connected to individuals which would be far lower (p.309).

		- The case was transferred from Irish regulators to EU regulators, which increased the fine, and then transferred back for Irish regulators to enforce it.
			- That shows that one member state was interpreting the rules differently than others.
		- Options for WhatsApp
			- One
				- Make a public statement, appologise, pay the fine.
			- Two
				- Appeal
				- Not pay the fine, fight it in court
			- They should take action
				- During the process?
					- Unless they are really hard to change or you are very sure you are rigght, you should take action immediatelly and implement changes.
				- Or after the decision?
					- [[WhatsApp]] did it after.
						- Why?
							- The internal operartion workflow did not priotitize the thing
							- Or they did not want to be transparent, cause that will show where they are not complying in more stuff.

					- 👎 These are *unregistered* design rights which offer

					  Community Design.'
					- Conclusion
						- Good if the design is going to be out of fashion quickly.
				- Registered
					- Conclusion
						- Good if the design is more timeless, like a brand assets.

				- Scope of protection
					- A registered trademark gives the owner the exclusive
					  right.
					- Protection lasts for 10 years from registration and
					  **can be renewed from then onwards without
					  limitation**.
			- **Principle of specialty** (classes)
				- The principle of speciality is based on the idea that if
				  the goods or services are different, they can 'share'
				  the same mark as consumers will understand that
				  they're different.
				- That then leads to the need for a given trademark to
				  be registered on specific classes in accordance with
				  the NICE classification.
				- The more classes you want to obtain protection with,
				  the more expensive it becomes.
				- Example
					- Cisco iPhone.
						- They were at risk of loosing it without using it.
						- So they had launch smth really fast to prove they use it.
					- Cars
				- But if Apple does not have a trademark class in clothing, it does not mean you can just print clothes with Apple logo. Apple logo may have ((65364c99-4ffa-457a-ae07-e9e8889d9246)) or ((65364ca9-db6e-41f0-b588-6da6696fe4b8)).
