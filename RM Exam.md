		- Purpose and academic profile
			- ```
			  BSc in Business Administration and Digital Management is an international and interdisciplinary program focused on the opportunities and challenges of digital transformations for corporate and organizational affairs. Students acquire the skills needed to work strategically in all kinds of organizations with a focus on digital transformations.
			  
			  The program combines insights from three different areas of expertise at CBS: organization and management studies, research on digital technologies and data, and business administration. Taken together, these enable students to participate in and manage digital transformations in organizational settings.
			  
			  The competencies needed to engage in these developments take a number of shapes. They include theoretical understandings of the intersection of digital transformations, commercial activities and organizational and other social processes. They also consist of analytical competencies and a mindset focused on innovation, creativity and reflexivity. Finally, understanding the dynamics of digital transformations requires both strategic and practical insights into the operations and needs of companies, the management of employees and processes, and how to relate to societal surroundings more broadly.
			  
			  Through advanced theoretical, methodological and practical approaches, BSc in Business Administration and Digital Management creates a stimulating and engaging learning environment that gives students a solid starting point for their academic and professional development.
			  ```
		- Competencies
		  id:: 6626a6df-f4d6-4d31-bcaa-095e76f65f57
			- ```
			  Analyse the workings of organizations, management processes and commercial activities, with particular attention to broader consequences of digital transformations.
			  Demonstrate a deep understanding and critical thinking when it comes to digital technologies, IT systems and data analytics, including the skills and resources to create strategic, commercial and societal value from these.
			  Evaluate opportunities and challenges that digital transformations create for business and society, and design concrete strategies and constructive solutions.
			  Communicate professionally with clients and colleagues and establish relations between people, who are working with technological, organizational and human issues.
			  Identify and acquire new skills independently and in collaboration with people across departments, professions and other borders.

Even though the supply of highly educated workforce has increased, their income has increased {{g "relatively to that of low-skilled labour"}}, which, according to the Neoclassical theory, should not be the case, and diminishing returns to capital should have taken place reducing the real wages (Toner, 2011).

					- tie it back to power, gender equality etc

				- The distribution of salary in departments is not a problem itself
					- Tie it into the managerial problems
						- f.e. white color jobs have bigger bugets that blue color jobs.
