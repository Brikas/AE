		- Do a diagnosis and solution
		- Pros and Cons of arguments
		- Example
			- Jie liang case
- Tips from teacher
	- dont use the word {{r follower}}
- Verified
	- Reema and the Accelerator case
		- Sticky-leaky
		- RTheory froma accelerator

	- Its important to understand the problem very well
- Posibilities
	- Maybe Valve and UNDP
		- [[leaderless leadership]]
- balance
	- Does not have to be 33/33/33

- TO get good grade, just replicate what is done in class
	- Descriptions of case
		- do not describe the whole case
			- its uneconomical
		- either all but super concise
		- or detail, focus on a detail
	- Define the context of the org, problem, etc.
	- Pros cons
	- Liek define lists of something on the wall
	- Then have multiple arguments.

	- Tell what you will do . DO it. Then tell what u done (most important things)
	- Summarizing theory
		- the theory says this
		- I like it because it help me understand
		- I choose it for
	- Theory
		- you can go with all leadership ones
		- but then relate to CM and Knowledge
	- f.e. (just an example)
		- 2 paras on each threy
		- 4 paras for each case
