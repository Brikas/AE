								- **Pluses**
									- it’s straightforward
									- it’s relatively easy to justify the price of a good or service
								- **Minuses**
									- not always easy to estimate what the costs of a product will be
									- After a price is set, raising the price is difficult, even if a company’s costs increase
									- is based on what a company thinks it should receive rather than what the market thinks a good or service is worth
										- Companies are finding it increasingly difficult to dictate prices to their customers, given customers’ ability to comparison shop
							- ((650f1b77-e8fe-4531-9766-6475f5fd5fac))
								- list price is determined by estimating what consumers are willing to pay for a product and then backing off a bit to provide a cushion.
									- **What willing to pay determined by**:
										- the perceived value of the product
											- A firm influences its customers’ perception of value through positioning, branding, promotions, and the other elements of its marketing plan.
										- the number of choices available in the marketplace.
								- **Pluses**
									- because it hinges on the perceived value of a product or service, rather than cost plus markup, which is a formula that ignores the customer.
									- Value-based pricing also frequently produces a higher gross margin.
										- **Example**: [[Intel]]
											- A gross margin (a company’s net sales minus its cost of goods sold) of 60 to 80 percent is not uncommon in high-tech industries. An Intel chip that sells for $300 may cost $50 to produce
								- **Minuses**
									- Often intangible and hard to measure
									- Requires deep knowledge about market and customers
									- Might have to be tested
							- *Most experts recommend value-based pricing*

								- **Example**: Ebay
									- Long text
										- There is an oftrepeated story about the early days of eBay that illustrates this point. During its beginning stages, eBay’s partners, Pierre Omidyar and Jeff Skoll, decided to recruit a CEO. They wanted someone who was not only experienced but also had the types of credentials that Wall Street investors’ value. They soon discovered that every experienced manager they tried to recruit asked if they had venture capital backing, which at the time they did not. For a firm trying to recruit a seasoned executive, at least at that time, venture capital backing was a sort of seal of legitimacy. To get this valuable seal, Omidyar and Skoll obtained funding from Benchmark Venture Capital, even though eBay didn’t really need the money. Writer Randall Stross recalls this event as follows:
										  
										  eBay was an anomaly: a profitable company that was able to self-fund its growth and that turned to venture capital solely for contacts and counsel. No larger lesson can be drawn. When Benchmark wired the first millions to eBay’s bank account, the figurative check was tossed into the vault—and there it would sit, unneeded and undisturbed
										  
										  This strategy worked for eBay. Soon after affiliating with Benchmark, Bob Kagle, one of Benchmark’s general partners, led eBay to Meg Whitman, an executive who had experience working for several top firms, including Procter & Gamble, Disney, and Hasbro. Whitman served as eBay’s CEO from 1998 to 2007
