			- saved [[democracy]] in some countries
		- Multilateral food aid program
		- Immediate Response Account
		- ERM program
			- “a process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed to **identify potential events that may affect the entity and manage risk to be within its risk appetite**, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity objectives.
	- Long run problem
		- she recognized that the cost of grains could increase sharply, just as oil had done.
			- costs were rising, and it was happening in new patterns, across markets where prices typically had been uncorrelated.
	- WFP Response to disaster

		- replied on entirely voluntary base of donations
		- WFP could use 7% of the operational cost to fund indirect support to field operations and administrative costs.
		- ❗️ Of the funds available for operations, more than 90% had been “directed”, or earmarked for particular crises, while less than 10% were “multilateral” and could be spent at WFP’s discretion
		  id:: 6622572e-4eeb-4ced-ae14-422afdf0893a
			- This lack of freedom constrained WFP’s ability to operate where they saw that the need was greatest unless it could raise additional funds from donor countries.
		- Country directors could borrow up to $500,000 from the internal **Immediate Response Account**
		- Fundraising
			- Central in Rome

		- He recruited corporate risk officer Kate Newton to coordinate enterprise-wide risk management activities.
		- October 2007 WFP Risk Profile
		  collapsed:: true
			- (1) potentially insufficient surge capacity, should the number and severity of natural and man-made disasters increase;
			- (2) potential reductions in WFP’s ability to raise funds, should donor and recipient governments’ perceptions of WFP’s relevance in the humanitarian assistance space change unfavorably;
			- (3) competition from other players, as high costs of procurement could drive donors to use non-WFP channels of delivering aid;
			- (4) failure to demonstrate adequate corporate governance and accountability to donors.
		- 2008 Risk Profile
		  collapsed:: true
			- “changes in the external environment,”

		- **1st - Be an aid organization**
		  id:: 66225a88-9602-4973-8822-13643aea51bb
			- core operation: bringing food to hungry populations in crisis situations.
			- saw WFP as a relief organization operating in the world’s danger zones and poor countries
		- **3rd - Be a hunger organization**
		  id:: 66226d08-15ec-4e93-81f4-2e88321e0988
			- {{g "The actual choice"}}
			- address root problems, instead of putting band aid
			- Focusing on the long-run factors
		- **2nd - Do both**
			- Both: ((66225a88-9602-4973-8822-13643aea51bb)), ((66226d08-15ec-4e93-81f4-2e88321e0988))
			- combined short-term emergency response operations with longer-term developmental objectives
			- But did WFP have a comparative advantage in non-relief situations? And did it always make sense to bring food into situations of entrenched poverty?

				- Two responses

					- Both are a vicious cycles.
						- Work more, use up more calories
						- Sell productive assets, make less money
			- Its not only a supply problem, its a demand problem.
				- tHe supply problem is in pockets
					- but solving the supply problems in the pockets, create new problems
						- {{embed ((66226d98-aaa4-48bc-8295-5253ccba2b4e))}}

			- They are really good at getting in places, where its super hard to get to.
				- People in the field a really good.
					- So the problem is centralized planning is that then its harder to include these experts in the field
			- In their DNA (and their [[competitive advantage]]) is to deliver the food to places in need fast.
			-
		- What they do?
			- They select the option - ((66226d08-15ec-4e93-81f4-2e88321e0988))
			- Then they frame it as a critical issue - something they are used to solve
			- But then the [[2008 Financial Crisis]] happens
			- Enabling leadership
				- **Adaptive Space**
					- They allow people in org to take 20% of their time to pursue their own projects.
						- They are given time and funds to do it.
	- Recap next class
		- Revision
			- Global Hunger
				- Why is it a complex problems?
					- Interconictivity
					- Reacting to it
					- vs
					- Solving it
				- It not only about supply of food
				  id:: 662b935a-8d86-45bb-a6ee-fc568021b32c
					- But also about entitlement, the ability to aquire food
			- Complicated vs Complex
				- You can construct a space ship with lego - its complicated, not complex
					- because the parts dont irreversibly change it other
			- WHO
				- The organization is really good at reacting. They are experts at it - best in the world.
					- Maybe not so much at solving it in the long-run.
				- The cup - it was really against the root hunger problem cause
					- {{embed ((662b935a-8d86-45bb-a6ee-fc568021b32c))}}
				- The power balance was not right to change
					- smth about the people in the field vs in the head
			- Hunger organization
				- They tried to switch to it
					- But they got hit by the crisis.
				- UNDP is doing smth like that

	- From class
		- Think of leadership as a **complex adaptive system**
		  collapsed:: true
			- Parts
				- complex
				- adaptive
				- system
			- Its an idea of a **network** of agent or nodes
				- that is organically self reproducing
				- the elements can interact with each other
				- builds and grows
					- which in turn changes the whole system
		- Complexity does not mean complicated.
			- Its means **rich interconnectivity**
				- Nodes interact with each other in way that unreversably change each other.
			- Example:
				- A fighter jet is is not complex, but its complicated
				- Mayonaise is simple, but its complex
					- You can unmake mayonaise from oil and (smth)
			- **Argument**: All organizations are complex. Becaue all human interactions change each other and may be irreversible.
			- Other theories
				- Monty Cole thought the system is complicated, but not complex.
				- [[Operational leadership]] vs [[Enabling leadership]]
				  id:: 662b9558-e065-48a0-aa27-29d27e4aba7b
					- Operational
						- someone is in charge and tell you waht to do (managerial)
						- tension and conflict is bad
						- bureaucracy
							- but its always bad
							- its predictible, reliable
								- ((662b9862-e4cf-4795-b53a-700e9ab55672))
					- Enabling
						- ...'
						- It embraces tension
						- Adaptive spaces is a wicked problem
						- Usualy u have a wicked problems
					- Maximizing effiiences vs Maximazing opportunities
					- Variations ([[Entrepreneurship]]) vs Reliability ([[Operational Leadership]])
					  id:: 662b9862-e4cf-4795-b53a-700e9ab55672
		- ((66226a74-2451-4384-9e07-1f601ee98a38))
		  collapsed:: true
			- Loosens the system up so adaptive change can occur.
				- Usually, one would prohibit the pressure. ((66226a5e-eb8c-4fb2-84dc-7ea853239feb))
			- In practice
				- Allow the conflict to be.
					- don't manage conflict.
					- It may be a bit discomforting at first
		- The best response to complexity is **more complexity**
		- Leadership is a ((66226b5b-4fcd-407c-9930-a82b7c5153fe))

			- Arena says that
	- In exam
		- Don't say "things are different and more complex now, than it used to be"
	- From ex notes
		- Basically it is...
		  collapsed:: true
			- What is being discovered in complexity leadership theory is that despite widespread belief that the role of the leader is to “reduce conflict” , the **conflict** experienced in the dynamic tension **between the two system**s is actually **the key to innovation** and adaptability in organizations #.v-self-border
		- Organizations as comprised of two primary systems
		  collapsed:: true
			- collapsed:: true
			  1. Operational system
				- When faced with complexity, Many organizations pull back to equilibrium. They operate as **complex systems**, but not **complex adaptive systems.**
				- Most common
					- Managers are trained to use rules and standard operating procedures to make decisions in the face of conflicting or challenging perspectives, eliminating or reducing adaptive tension in the system
					- Employees are trained to push decision-making responsibility up
					-
			- 2. Entrepreneurial system
